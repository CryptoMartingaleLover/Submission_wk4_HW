The assignment was to utilize Pandas to manipulate investment data of several portfolios and their associated tickers. We were to use the data to render various visual plots and then analyze the data to
determine which were the best investments. 

We were then instructed to choose 3 to 5 additional stock tickers, run similar operations on them, and then put their data together with the original set of investments. Lastly we were to analyze the performance of our portfolio selections as compared with the market and the selections that were provided to us.
